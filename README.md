# Welcome to Linux Excercises

## Bandit Level 0
## [Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)
The goal of this level on OverTheWire's Bandit game is for you to log into the game using SSH. 

- The host to which you need to connect is `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.
- The port is `2220`.
- The username is `bandit0`.
- The password is `bandit0`.

Once logged in, you can proceed to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1. [^5^]

If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, you can open a terminal and enter the following command to connect:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted for the password. Enter `bandit0`, and you should be logged in.

Please note that if you're using Windows, you might need an SSH client like PuTTY to do this.
