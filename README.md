# Welcome to Linux Excercises

## Bandit Level 0
## [Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)
The goal of this level on OverTheWire's Bandit game is for you to log into the game using SSH. 

- The host to which you need to connect is `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.
- The port is `2220`.
- The username is `bandit0`.
- The password is `bandit0`.

Once logged in, you can proceed to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1. [^5^]

If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, you can open a terminal and enter the following command to connect:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted for the password. Enter `bandit0`, and you should be logged in.

Please note that if you're using Windows, you might need an SSH client like PuTTY to do this.

## Bandit Level 1 [Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

The goal of the Bandit Level 1 on OverTheWire is to find the password for the next level. The password is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory. Once you find the password, you should use it to log into `bandit1` using SSH[^13^].

To find the password, after you have logged into the game with the credentials for `bandit0`, you can use the `cat` command to read the `readme` file:

```bash
cat ~/readme
```

This command will output the contents of the `readme` file, which should be the password for `bandit1`. You can then use this password to log into `bandit1` and proceed with the game.

Here's the command to log into `bandit1` (replace `password` with the actual password you found):

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted for the password. Enter the password you found, and you should be logged in.

## Bandit Level # 1 â†’ Level 2

The goal of the Bandit Level 2 on OverTheWire is to find the password for the next level. The password is stored in a file named `-` located in the home directory[^21^].

As the file has a special name (`-`), you'll need to provide a path to the `cat` command to avoid interpretation of the `-` as a special character. You can use `./-` to refer to the file in the current directory:

```bash
cat ./-
```

This command will output the contents of the file `-`, which should be the password for `bandit2`. You can then use this password to log into `bandit2` and proceed with the game.

Here's the command to log into `bandit2` (replace `password` with the actual password you found):

```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

After running this command, you'll be prompted for the password. Enter the password you found, and you should be logged in.   [^21^]: [source](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)
